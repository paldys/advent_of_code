# AdventOfCode

This is app solves puzzles from https://adventofcode.com/

To run the code use `mix solve <day> <puzzle> [<year>]`, e.g. `mix solve 7 2` will solve the second puzzle from Day 7 for the most recent year.

To run tests use `mix test --exclude slow`, this will not run the tests that take too long.
